For Client-server model:
run rem_mes.py, rem_vid.py on the remote end and run con_mes.py, con_vid.py on the control end to transmit data and video.

For Client-server-Client model:
run remtri_mes.py, remtri_vid.py on the remote end, run contri_mes.py, contri_vid.py on the control end and run server_mes.py, server_vid.py to transmit data and video.

The Kalman filter folder includes the magnetometer calibration code and one Client-server model control end data transmission code with Kalman filter.
